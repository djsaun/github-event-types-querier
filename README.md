## GitHub Repository Event Type Querier

This application allows you to query users' repositories by event type. The form requires an owner’s name and a repository’s name to successfully submit. On submit, all events within the repository are displayed and the event type select dropdown becomes available. The options in the select dropdown are dynamically generated from all applicable event types within the repo and selecting an option will display all events of that event type. 

To start the application, clone this repository, cd into the directory, and run:

```npm start```

 or 
 
 ```yarn start```
